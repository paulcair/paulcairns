      <description>Equipment Details Belty V2.0 is a belt driven 3D printer designed and built in EnergyLab-Lome. This is the result of our second spiral, which built on our first spiral named Belty. You can find details on how Belty was made here. In the first version we were focused on the belt system and optimising it using the available materials we could lay our hands on. With this Version 2, we focused more on making an actual 3D belt printer where we added an extruder and a new RAMPS control board using the Merlin firmware.</description>

      <description>Background and Inspiration I came across this video on social media and got inspired to see if I could replicate it by dusting off an old face detection app I made that uses OpenCV.&#xA;The video of the project that inspired this is below:&#xA;As part of the challenge, I wanted to avoid looking at any documentation that the project included and just try to design the project from scratch using only the video as guidance and to see how I might be able to improve upon the hardware.</description>

      <description>The assignment to be completed over two weeks was to build a machine that had a mechanical and electronic component that could be actuated and automated to perform a certain task. This week I worked with my lab instructor Jason to build a rotary casting and photogrammetry machine. The assignment details and learning outcomes are given below.&#xA;Mechanical Design (part 1 of 2)&#xA;Group assignment:&#xA;Design a machine that includes mechanism + actuation + automation Build the mechanical parts and operate it manually.</description>

      <description>Revisions to final video based on comments from final presentation After presenting my final project in the final presentation session, I received the feedback that the final project was good but the video needed the following elements to be demonstrated more clearly:&#xA;Show the functionality of the temperature gauge more clearly Show voltage and current of the pelletier modules to make clear that there is power being generated by them Make it more clear that the fan is working.</description>
