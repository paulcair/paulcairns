      <description>On this page, the objective was to showcase how to program a microcontroller chip on a circuit board that was designed during my Fab Academy week 7 &amp;ldquo;electronics design&amp;rdquo; assignment. As usual, the assignment had a group and individual element. Below are the details.&#xA;Group assignment:&#xA;Compare the performance and development workflows for different microcontroller families Document your work (in a group or individually) Individual assignment:&#xA;Read the datasheet for the microcontroller you are programming Program the board you have made to do something, with as many different programming languages and programming environments as possible.</description>
