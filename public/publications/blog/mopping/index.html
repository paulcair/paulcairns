<p>&ldquo;You missed a spot!&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing it too quickly, be smoother, like a dance&hellip; focus Paul&hellip; focus!&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re moving too jerky, smoother&rdquo;, he interrupted my thoughts.</p>
<p>The words hit me like a ton of bricks, having not heard anyone speak directly to me in so long.</p>
<p>&hellip;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going quickly because i just want to finish this job and get the hell out of here&rdquo;, I thought, but didn&rsquo;t verbalize.</p>
<p>After 10 days without speaking I still wasn&rsquo;t ready to talk much.</p>
<p>The room went silent again&hellip;</p>
<p>Swish. Swish. Plunge. Plunge.<br>
Swish. Swish. Plunge. Plunge.</p>
<p>He peered over from across the room, and sensing my lack of commitment to the excercise, walked over and stopped me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look&rdquo;, he said. <strong>&ldquo;The art of mopping is to be perfectly present with every stroke.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>He begins demonstrating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Pay attention to every detail on the floor.<br>
Give it the attention it deserves.<br>
Realize that you are giving it new life.<br>
Notice every footprint that you wash away and appreciate the impermanence of it.<br>
That someone stood here, or sat there, and had thoughts and contributed to the karma of this room.<br>
As you mop: <strong>be grateful for what was; be fully present to what is; and realize that your small actions are giving new life</strong> to this floor for a NEW set of students, that will have thoughts and contribute to the karma next week.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I know its been a long 10 days and you&rsquo;re, keen to get out of here&rdquo;&hellip; he continued as if reading my thoughts&hellip; <strong>&ldquo;but where will you really be going if you aren&rsquo;t truly present.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>It was the final day of a 10 day Vipassana meditation retreat, in which you stay at a centre in the woods for 10 days, no cell phone, no reading, no writing, and no talking (called noble silence). Our noble silence had naught ended 3 hours ago, and we were doing final clean up - yes, here you had to clean up after yourself - before we could go home. I had been assigned the duty of mopping the meditation room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now&rdquo;, he hands me back the mop, &ldquo;continue as i have shown you and enjoy the art of mopping&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I took my time, gave my care, and finished. After the 10 days I spent at that meditation centre, that was the most profound lesson I had ever learned&hellip; The universe&rsquo;s secrets all unveiled with a mop.</p>
