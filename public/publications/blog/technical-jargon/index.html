    <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m an engineer, not a linguist. I don&rsquo;t think in words, I think in terms of images, bodies, motion, potential difference, electrons, and molecules.</p>
<p>Ask me to describe any physical phenomena and I can do it in a way that a four year old can understand. Ask me what the engineering term is for a certain phenomenon and I will give you a blank stare. This has been a challenge to me during corporate interview processes. I will be asked a technical question, and I will answer in a way that is intuitive and in a way that the interviewer even will say &ldquo;I know what you&rsquo;re trying to say&rdquo;, but what is the &ldquo;term&rdquo; for that.</p>
<p>One such example, is a time I was describing the design selection processess, and was talking about how you break the system down into distinct parts or functions, identify the objectives and criteria, give a weighting to each criteria, and then identify potential solutions that could meet that objective and compare them by how they score against each criteria to select the best component. A process I have used numerous times on many many engineering projects. A process that I clearly understand. The response: &ldquo;What is the term for that process&rdquo;, I forgot the name (the answer is Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis or MCDA).</p>
<p>This has happened numerous times:</p>
<p>(1) I, in detail, described how a pressure vessel for a Pressurize Thermo Gravimetric Analyzer (PTGA) I designed failed because the metal&rsquo;s strength reduced due to the high temperature and a stress concentration was created because the ports were fixed on both ends and so there was no place for the tube to thermally expand, but I failed to use the word &ldquo;yield stress&rdquo;</p>
<p>(2) I, again in detail, accurately described how I would perform an FEA analysis on a cantilevered beam both  static, and under cyclic fatigue loading but failed to use the term &ldquo;S-N diagram&rdquo; for how I would generate a report of the results (even though I have performed FEA before and know what an S-N diagram is in practice, I just forgot the name)</p>
<p>This was a very frustrating, as to me it showed that recruiters value technical jargon and people who are able to &ldquo;sound&rdquo; smart, over people with actual fundemental understanding of engineering process and design. Look at my portfolio page, my work speaks for itself. If you want someone who can sound smart, hire ChatGPT. But an engineer should be measured on their intuition and ability to explain a problem in the simplest terms possible, not on their ability to recite acronyms and technical jargon. I think this is really hurting corporations and the recruitment process.</p>
<p>I personally, am now of the opinion that technical jargon is a crutch that people without fundemental undertanding of a problem use to excuse themselves from gaining a fundemental understanding.</p>
<p>As Einstein said: &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t explain it simply, you don&rsquo;t understand it well enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elon Musk said: &ldquo;There is a creeping tendency to use made up acronyms at SpaceX. Excessive use of made up acronyms is a significant impediment to communication… No one can actually remember all these acronyms and people don’t want to seem dumb in a meeting, so they just sit there in ignorance. This is particularly tough on new employees.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="the-solution">The Solution</h2>
<p>This is why I think recruiters and engineers should frame their questions to get someone to explain in the simplest terms possible their approach to a problem, and should have a non-engineer on the call and the non-engineer should be the jury on how well the candidate was able to explain the problem. If the non-engineer was able to understand the problem and also the solution, that is the marker of fundemental understanding.</p>
