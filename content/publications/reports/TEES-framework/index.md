# Background

The ENERGICA project is a multifaceted consortium funded by the Horizon 2020 initiative of the
European Commission. The project brings several consortium members together to support three
Energy Access demonstration projects across Sub Saharan Africa (SSA). The overall concept of the
project is “to develop and demonstrate in real environments that existing technologies can be tailored
through efficient and sustainable community-based approaches in any type of societal contexts”. [1]
As such, three different contexts for energy access were selected across SSA as demonstrators. They
are:
1. A rural context in Madagascar that offers nano-grids as a form of green energy access.
2. A peri-urban/urban context in Sierra Leone that offers green energy access through biogas.
3. An urban context in Kenya that offers green energy transportation with electromobility.
The overarching objective of the project is to sufficiently “demonstrate the efficient implementation
of renewable energy technologies to match local contexts’ needs.” [1] This will be achieved by taking
a wholesome approach to technology development in each region. This report focuses on the capacity
building programmes that will be implemented to ensure the success of each demonstrator.
