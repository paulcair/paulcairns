The project I will work on using OnShape is a omnidirectional gear that I plan to 3D print using my SLA printer. Below is a presentation of the workflow to use the Anycubic Photon Mono 2 SLA printer.

# Setting up the printer

SLA printers require minimal setup, simply take it out of the box, place the screen protector on and install the build plate and resin bath. You can learn about the setup process by quickly scrolling through the [User Manual](../anycubic-printer.pdf) below.

Once set up, I will walk through the zeroing and bed levelling technique in the workflow section below.

# SLA 3D Printing Workflow for Anycubic Photon Mono 2

In this section I will cover the workflow for perfoming an SLA print from import of the part to the Photon Workshop software and slicing it, through to preparing the printer for a print, launching a print, post-print treatment and cleanup. This section will be broken into two parts: 

    (1) Slicing and creating the print file, and
    (2) Performing the print and cleanup 

## Slicing a part for printing
