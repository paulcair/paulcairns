## Specifications of LeArm

For this project I used LeArm 6 DOF robot kit as an off the shelf robot arm. It is programmable and controllable. I would like to tie it with a computer vision AI program to recognize little cubes, calculate their coordinates, move to that position to grab the cube, and then place the cube in a little basket.

Below are the details and specifications for LeArm.
